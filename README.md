> A graph-based navigation system that finds the shortest path between locations within a campus.

---

## 📖 Overview

The **Smart Campus Navigation System** is a menu-driven application that helps users navigate through a campus (or any mapped environment). It models locations as **vertices** and connections as **edges**, allowing users to compute the shortest path between two points efficiently.

This project applies fundamental concepts in **data structures and algorithms and discrete structures**, particularly graph theory and pathfinding.

## ✨ Features

* 📍 Add and manage locations (vertices)
* 🔗 Create connections between locations (edges)
* 📋 Display all locations and their connections
* 🔍 Check if two locations are connected
* 🧭 Find the shortest path between two points
* 📏 Show number of steps in the shortest and longest path
